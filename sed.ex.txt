Histone modifications
are implicated in influencing gene expression.
We have generated high-resolution maps for
the genome-wide distribution of
20 histone lysine and arginine
methylations as well as
histone variant H2A.Z,
RNA polymerase II,
and the insulator binding protein
CTCF across the human genome
using the Solexa 1G sequencing
technology. Typical patterns of
histone methylations exhibited at
promoters, "insulators", enhancers,
and transcribed regions are identified.
The monomethylations of H3K27, H3K9,
H4K20, H3K79, and H2BK5 are all
linked to gene activation,
whereas trimethylations of
H3K27, H3K9, and H3K79 are
linked to repression. H2A.Z
associates with functional
regulatory "elements", and
CTCF marks boundaries of histone
methylation domains. Chromosome
banding patterns are correlated
with unique patterns of histone
modifications. Chromosome breakpoints
detected in T cell cancers frequently
reside in chromatin regions associated with H3K4 methylations.
Our data provide new insights into the function
of histone methylation and chromatin organization in genome function.
